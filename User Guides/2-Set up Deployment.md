# Setting up the Deployment

Before you start the deployment, confirm that you have an Azure subscription with sufficient quota, and have implemented the prerequisites.

The deployment starts by clicking on the DEPLOY button on the main landing page - which is README.md in the GitHub, or the solutions page in the Cortana Gallery. Once you click on DEPLOY, the deployment platform takes you through a series of questions to set up the TRI.

This section explains each parameter in detail.
