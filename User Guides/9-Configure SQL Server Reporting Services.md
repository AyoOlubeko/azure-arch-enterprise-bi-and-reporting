# Configuring Reporting Services
**SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)** is part of Microsoft SQL Server services - SSRS,  SSAS and SSIS. It is a server-based report generating software system that can create, deploy and manage traditional and mobile ready paginated reports via a modern web portal.

### Connect to SSRS Web Portal
Deploying the solution, provisions two SSRS virtual machines frontended by an [Azure Load balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/load-balancer/) for high availability and performance. Follow the next steps to connect to the SSRS admin web-portal.  
1. Obtain the **SSRS** load balancer url from the deployment summary page. 
	- For instance `http://<unique_name_prefix>ssrslb.ciqsedw.ms/reports`.
![ssrs-url](../img/ssrs-url.png)  
2. Point your web browser to the SSRS load balancer url.
3. Enter the admin credentials on the prompt. 
	- Username name **MUST** be a user that can authenticate against the SQL Server in the format **domain\username**. For instance `ciqsedw\edwadmin`. 
	- Password is the SSRS admin password.

4. If everything works correctly, you should now have successfully authenticated and can access the reports and data sources.

### Subscribing to Reports via Email
This step isn't automated by the solution, however, users can manually configure email subscription in very few steps. The following requirements must be met for this.  
- Create a SendGrid SMTP username and password on [Azure](portal.azure.com)
- Enter these created credentials on the **SSRS Server** for email delivery.  


#####  1. Create SendGrid SMTP credentials on Azure
1. Go to [Azure](portal.azure.com)
2. Search for **SendGrid Email Delivery** from the market place.
3. Create a new SendGrid account
